## ABSTRACT :
Chatbots are regularly used to add to the user experience on many websites, social media apps and mobile devices. These bots are used to faster access for the information. Nowadays boys are playing a major role. Many of the chat bots are used by the people in order to access the right information from the internet. Bots are made from sets of algorithms that aid them in their designated tasks. These tasks include conversing with a human -- which attempts to mimic human behaviors -- or gathering content from other websites. There are several different types of bots designed to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. Some bots are automated so that there is no human effort to be made especially for the tasks.
